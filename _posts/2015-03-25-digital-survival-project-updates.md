It has been a while, has not it? Although this site has not been updated a while, a lot has happened on the home front. I wanted to write a little update to let those who may be interested know that Digital Survival is over. On the contrary Digital Survival is just beginning...

I'm still very much interested in moving this project forward, but since I have been learning so many new technologies recently it has been difficult to allot much time here. Things should be ironed out in the next couple of weeks. There is some personal projects that are finally coming to a close which will free me up to some more brain storming.

Recently I read the [Appropriate Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology) article on Wikipedia. I'm not entirely sure as of now, but I believe Digital Survival is a appropriate technology proponent. As far as I understand, appropriate technology provides a great summary of what I want to provide Digital Survival for people.

There will be more to come on this aspect on the future when I get the a mission statement worked out.
