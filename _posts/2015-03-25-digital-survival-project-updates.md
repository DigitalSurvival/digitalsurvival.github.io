It has been a while, has not it? Although this site has not been updated a while, a lot has happened on the home front. I wanted to write a little update to inform those who may be interested that Digital Survival is not over. On the contrary Digital Survival is just beginning...

I'm still very much interested in moving this project forward, but since I have (lately) been learning so many new technologies it has been difficult to allot much time here. Things should be ironed out in the next couple of weeks. There is some personal projects that are finally coming to a close which will free me up to some more brain storming and actual work on this side of things.

Recently I read the [Appropriate Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology) article on Wikipedia. I'm not entirely sure yet, but I believe Digital Survival is an appropriate technology proponent. As far as I understand, the appropriate technology article on Wikipedia provides a great summary of what I want Digital Survival to be.

There will be more to come on these thoughts in the future when I get some kind of a mission statement worked out.
