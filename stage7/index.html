		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in" align="LEFT"><font size="3">The software is
		in development, but beauty of GitHub is that you can have access to
		it right now! Simply fork or clone the Stage7 repository. If you are
		only interested in a finished version, you should dismay. An actual
		due date is not set, as I am only able to work on the project in my
		spare time (I work a full time job and I am actively involved at my
		church).</font></p>

		<p style="margin-bottom: 0in" align="LEFT"><font size="3">There are lots
		of ways you can help with the project. Having this page (and the
		Digital Survival) website re-written beautifully would be a big way
		you can help... You should e-mail me if you have any questions,
		concerns, feature requests, or suggestions! You can do so by
		combining my GitHub user name and @gmail.com together.</font></p>
